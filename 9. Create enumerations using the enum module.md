### Guided Practice 

```python
from enum import Enum  
  
class DayOfWeek(Enum):  
    SUNDAY = 0  
    MONDAY = 1  
    TUESDAY = 2  
    WEDNESDAY = 3  
    THURSDAY = 4  
    FRIDAY = 5  
    SATURDAY = 6  
  
  
print("Let's loop through the days of week")  
  
for dow in DayOfWeek:  
    print(dow)  
  
print("\nLet's get the value SUNDAY")  
dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.SUNDAY  
print(f"name: {dayOfWeek.name}")  
print(f"value: {dayOfWeek.value}")
```


We can get much more elaborate with enums, capturing multiple properties and even adding methods. We just have to intercept the `__new__` method to instruct how to create each enumerable and assign the values. 

```python
from enum import Enum  
  
class DayOfWeek(Enum):  
    SUNDAY = (0, "SUN", True)  
    MONDAY = (1, "MON", False)  
    TUESDAY = (2, "TUES", False)  
    WEDNESDAY = (3, "WED", False)  
    THURSDAY = (4, "THUR", False)  
    FRIDAY = (5, "FRI", False)  
    SATURDAY = (6, "SAT", True)  
  
    def __new__(cls, dow_index, abbreviation, is_weekend):  
        # Create the enum member  
        obj = object.__new__(cls)  
        obj._value_ = dow_index  
        obj.dow_index = dow_index  
        obj.abbreviation = abbreviation  
        obj.is_weekend = is_weekend  
        return obj  
  
    @property  
    def monday_first_dow_index(self):  
        return (self.dow_index - 1) % 7  
  
print("Let's loop through the days of week")  
for dow in DayOfWeek:  
    print(dow)  
  
print("\nLet's get the value SUNDAY")  
dayOfWeek = DayOfWeek.SUNDAY  
print(f"name: {dayOfWeek.name}")  
print(f"value: {dayOfWeek.value}")  
print(f"dow_index: {dayOfWeek.dow_index}")  
print(f"abbreviation: {dayOfWeek.abbreviation}")  
print(f"is_weekend: {dayOfWeek.is_weekend}")  
print(f"monday_first_dow_index: {dayOfWeek.monday_first_dow_index}")
```

### Try-it-yourself

```python
from enum import Enum  
  
# Implement an enum for ColorTheme  
# that has the values LIGHT, DARK, DRACULA, and HIGH_CONTRAST.  
# Loop through the four values  
# Then set a color_theme variable to DRACULA  
  
class ColorTheme(Enum):  
    LIGHT = 1  
    DARK = 2  
    DRACULA = 3  
    HIGH_CONTRAST = 4  
  
for ct in ColorTheme:  
    print(ct)  
  
color_theme = ColorTheme.DRACULA  
  
print(f"The color theme was set to: {color_theme}")
```
