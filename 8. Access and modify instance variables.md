### Guided Practice 

```python
class Dog:  
    def __init__(self, name, age):  
        self.name = name  
        self.age = age  
  
# Create an object  
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  
  
# Access instance variables  
print(my_dog.name)  # Output: Buddy  
print(my_dog.age)   # Output: 3  
  
# It's Buddy's birthday!  
# Let's modify his age my_dog.age += 1  
print(f"Buddy is now {my_dog.age} years old!")  
  
# Let's add a breed property  
# Note this is not a great practice, 
# but it demonstrates how *anything*
# can be mutated in Python
my_dog.breed = "Golden Retriever"  
print(f"Buddy is a {my_dog.breed}")
```

However, this direct mutation of variables in an object is discouraged. It is better for the class to have methods that manage the changing of the variables. 

```python
class Dog:  
    def __init__(self, name, age):  
        self.name = name  
        self.age = age  
  
    def set_age(self, age):  
        if age >= 0:  
            self.age = age  
        else:  
            raise ValueError("Age cannot be negative!")  
  
    def increment_age(self):  
        self.age += 1  
  
my_dog = Dog("Buddy", 3)  
my_dog.set_age(4)   
my_dog.increment_age()
```

### Try-it-yourself

Fix this `VotingPoll` class and its usage so that it is well-encapsulated and uses methods to increment votes, as well as have all candidate votes managed by the class. 

```python
class VotingPoll:  
    def __init__(self):  
        self.candidate_A = 0  
        self.candidate_B = 0  
  
voting_poll = VotingPoll()  
  
# oof! This shouldn't be out here! 
voting_poll.candidate_C = 0   

# give 3 votes to candidate A  
voting_poll.candidate_A += 1  
voting_poll.candidate_A += 1  
voting_poll.candidate_A += 1  
  
# give 2 votes to candidate B  
voting_poll.candidate_B += 1  
voting_poll.candidate_B += 1   

# give 1 vote to candidate C  
voting_poll.candidate_C += 1   

print(f"A: {voting_poll.candidate_A}, B: {voting_poll.candidate_B}, C: {voting_poll.candidate_C}")
```

SOLUTION:

```python
class VotingPoll:  
    def __init__(self):  
        self.candidate_A = 0  
        self.candidate_B = 0  
        self.candidate_C = 0
  
    def vote_candidate_A(self):  
        self.candidate_A += 1  
  
    def vote_candidate_B(self):  
        self.candidate_B += 1  
        
    def vote_candidate_C(self):  
        self.candidate_C += 1   
        
voting_poll = VotingPoll()  
  
# give 3 votes to candidate A  
voting_poll.vote_candidate_A()  
voting_poll.vote_candidate_A()  
voting_poll.vote_candidate_A()  
  
# give 2 votes to candidate B  
voting_poll.vote_candidate_B()  
voting_poll.vote_candidate_B()  
  
# give 1 vote to candidate C 
voting_poll.vote_candidate_C()  

print(f"A: {voting_poll.candidate_A}, B: {voting_poll.candidate_B}, C: {voting_poll.candidate_C}")
```
